            I am currently a student at UW-Green Bay, studying in IT and Game Design. This portfolio is part of the Computer Science 201 course project list, and is to help show our understanding of things like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. You can find examples of the games we have created under the <a href="https://itzelectrolite.github.io/jaredb-portfolio/GAMES.html"> GAMES </a> tab. I also listed some of the current games I am working on or plan to work on.

                My dad was in the navy while I was growing up, so video games were one of the tools I used to stay entertained growing up. Out of all the games I've played throughout my life, I love competitive games like Fortnite and Rocket League. One of my favorites would have to be Pokemon, having attended several Regional and International events over the span of 2 years as of 2025. I'm also a big fan of racing games, especially an old PS3 classic, Motorstorm, since that was a majority of the genres I had growing up. Open-world games are also on my list, moreso for their sandbox elements, especiall the GTA series.

                Lego was one of the biggest parts of my childhood, and allowed me to create anything I could imagine as a kid. I'd like to think that that toy line brought me to wanting to create something bigger, like my first game. That as well all the times I spent watching the behind the scenes videos on Disney/Pixar DVDs, or some select video games, and being facinated by the people working on the movie/game.
